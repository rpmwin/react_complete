      <h2>Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        Those devotees who recite these verses with love and unwavering faith
        have all their beneficial desires fulfilled by Hanuman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glory to Hanuman, the benefactor of saints. Please listen to our prayer.
        Do not delay in doing the work of your devotees. Please rush to do it
        and give us immense peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Come running] just like when you leapt accross the ocean, entered and
        then emerged from the expanded mouth of Surasa [who tried to obstruct
        your path], and on landing in Lanka sent the demoness Lankini to the
        heavenly abode by kicking her to death [when she tried to prevent you
        from entering the city].
      </p>
      <p>
        In Lanka you gave pleasure to Vibhishan [by meeting him] and attained
        the supreme position [of being loved by Sri Ram] due to Sita's merciful
        benediction. Then you laid waste the Ashoka grove and dumped the trees
        in the ocean, symbolically breaking the knife of Yama, the God of Death.
      </p>
      <p>
        You killed Akshay Kumar (Ravana's son) and burnt Lanka with your tail.
        Lanka burned like lac (molten wax) and the heavens were filled by the
        sound of “Hail to Hanuman's glory”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why are you delaying now my Lord; you know what resides in the minds of
        your devotees, so have mercy on me. Glory to you who restored the life
        of Lakshman. Quickly dispel my fears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hail to you, holder of the mountain! You are an ocean of happiness,
        wisest amongst gods and the most skillful. O you of indomitable spirit
        kill the enemies (lust, anger, greed…) as if they were nailed by the
        strike of a thunderbolt.
      </p>
      <p>
        O Lord! Relieve your servant by hitting the enemies with your mace as if
        it were a thunderbolt. Saying the thundering sound of OM, challenge the
        enemies and crush them with your mace.
      </p>
      <p>
        O Hanuman, Lord of the Monkeys, I invoke you with the Tantric mantra Oṁ
        hrīn hrīn hrīn and Oṁ hũ hũ hũ. Strike the enemy in the chest and head.
        I swear by the name of Hari that all that I say is the truth. O
        messenger of Sri Ram, rush to attack the enemy at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glory to you, o fathomless Hanuman! Due to which offence is your devotee
        suffering so much? This servant of yours knows nothing of worship,
        sacred mantras, penance, or the discipline of rituals and virtuous acts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relying on your strength, I have no fear anywhere - whether in the
        forest, garden, mountains, on the road, or in the house. I fall at your
        feet and entreat you with folded hands [to help me]. For whom else shall
        I call at this hour?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hail Hanuman! All-powerful son of Anjani and brave son of Shiva. You
        have a fierce and terrifying body and are the slayer of even the God of
        Death's minions. You are always by the side of Sri Ram and are the
        benefactor of all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slay all evil spirits: ghosts, spirits, hobgoblins, demons, fire,
        vampires, calamities, and epidemics. Kill all of them in the name of
        Lord Sri Ram thereby maintaining the sanctity and truth of the holy
        name.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the servant of Sri Ram and Mother Sita. I implore you in their
        names - make no delay. The sky is reverberating with the sound of your
        glories, the mere remembrance of which dispels all sorrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have come to take refuge at your feet. I plead with you; who else
        shall I call for help in this time of urgent need? Get up, get up, come
        along! I urge you with folded hands to swing into action.
      </p>
      <p>
        I implore you O nimble-footed Hanuman with the call of Oṁ chãṁ chãṁ chãṁ
        chãṁ and Oṁ hanu hanu hanu hanu. Strike swiftly like lightning! O
        Hanuman, you are swift. Whenever the monkeys roar, the crowd of
        evil-doers flee in terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        Save this devotee of yours immediately. I get immense pleasure
        remembering you. Who can save one who is attacked with the arrow of
        Bajarang Baan (literally meaning an arrow as strong as a thunderbolt)
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who recite these verses of Bajarang Baan are protected for life by
        Hanuman. Even ghosts and evil spirits tremble out of fear of those who
        chant this Bajarang
      </p>

      <p>
        Those who wave incense sticks in front of you and chant your holy name
        are always free from bodily torments of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who chant Hanuman's holy name with faith, devotion, and love and
        always remember him in their hearts are sure to have all their desires
        fulfilled by Hanuman.
