#start of reactjs !!!

to create a react app you can directly go with the OG - method : npx create-react-app 
this method usually is not efficient method of running and consumes more energy...

one more  way to install is $ npm create vite@latest : this is a vite bundler and this installs a a bare minimum react app which consumes less energy ....
